Are you bored with sending birthday wishes to your friends or do you forget to send wishes to your friends or do you want to wish them at 12 AM but you always fall asleep? Why not automate this simple task by writing a Python script.

The first thing we do is import six libraries: 

pandas
datetime
smtplib
time
requests
win10toast
Apart from this, Also create an Excel sheet for containing records like this: Name, Email, Contact, Birthday, and Year. 

Approach:

For the sending email part, We define a sendEmail() function which will start a Gmail session, send the email, and quit the session.
For the SMS part, we must have an account on www.fast2sms.com from where we will get an API key. This API key is used to send SMS over mobile numbers using your account on fast2sms then We create a sendsms() function which will verify the API key and send SMS.
In the driver code section, we read the data from Excel sheet and match todayâ€™s date with any of the birthdays. If there is a match, we call the sendEmail() and sendsms() functions and also we add the current year in the Excel sheet. Also, we have used ToastNotifier from win10toast library to show desktop notifications once the e-mail and SMS has been sent successfully.
